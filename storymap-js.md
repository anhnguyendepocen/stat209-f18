## Mapping with StoryMap.js

Today we are going to use a tool called **StoryMap.js** in order to do digital
storytelling with maps and other media elements. For day-to-day use, I would
not recommend this tool because:

1. No way to export your raw data for archiving or storing in another platform.
2. Not clear where your data sits on the KnightLab website.
3. Can only use media that is supported by the tool. 
4. Only load one piece of media per slide.
5. Most default style choices cannot be overridden or changed.
6. Sometimes it doesn't work quite right.

But for a first attempt at using digital tools to tell a multimedia story it is
a great way to get quickly started.

### Getting Started

Start by going to the KnigtLab website for the tool: [StoryMap.js](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)
and click on "Make a StoryMap". It will ask you to sign into a Google account. You can use
your UR account or your own personal Google account name and password. Finally, it will ask
you to name your StoryMap. Let's call it "mylife" (though you can really name it whatever
you want).

The storymap is comprised of a series of slides with a spatial component. It words best when the
number of slides doesn't exceed ~20 and the story is relatively contained. Each slide has four (not
all required) components:

1. Location and scale of the map.
2. Headline, or title, of the slide.
3. Text.
4. Media (image or video).

To get a sense of what a completed map looks like, take a look at [taylor's life](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/f6cbd985c900df9987cfd40e4d69493a/test2/index.html).

To build your own StoryMap, start by clicking on "Add Slide" on the left-hand side of the screen.
It won't seem to do much at first. Let's add each of the four elements to the slide. We want
a slide with the following information:

1. Located in our current location
2. Headline: Explorations in American Mathematics
3. Text: Something you are excited about learning/working on this semester
4. An image of your favorite mathematician.

Let's go through these steps one at a time:

1. **Determine where the slide's location will be on the map** You could do this by scrolling
and shifting the world map or making use of the search feature. I suggest using the search
feature to find the University of Richmond and then dragging the map to our building manually.
Note that the slide will use the zoom level that you selected.
2. Type the headline in the box below.
3. Type the text in the box below.
4. **Add media**: Find an image online of your favorite mathematician. Wikipedia is a good
place to find this; Google images works as well. Once you find the image either right-click
(Windows) or control click (Mac) on the image and select "Copy Image Location" on the pull
down menu. Paste this location into the media field on StoryMap and hit enter. The image 
should now appear.

To see your completed slide, click on Preview. To return to edit it, select Edit. If you
want to share the slides with someone else, click on "Share" In the upper right-hand corner.

### Task

We are now going to build a set of slides that explains yourself to the rest of the class.
It needs to have only 5-6 slides and can contain whatever life events you would like to 
share with the class. Each slide should include a short title, one to two sentences about
the event, and some media such as an image or a YouTube video. The last slide should be the
one about this class.

We will work on these now in class.
