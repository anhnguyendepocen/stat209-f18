**Due**: 2018-12-04 (start of class)

**Starter code**: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsmaths/stat209-f18/master/projects/project-iv.Rmd" download="project-iv.Rmd" target="_blank">project-iv.Rmd</a>,
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsmaths/stat209-f18/master/projects/project-iv-lab.Rmd" download="project-iv-lab.Rmd" target="_blank">project-iv-lab.Rmd</a>

**Rubric**: [project-iv-rubric.csv](https://github.com/statsmaths/stat209-f18/blob/master/projects/project-iv-rubric.csv)

For this project you are going to select a topic in statistical programming or
data analysis that we have not covered. You will create a set of class tutorial
notes and a lab similar to the ones we have used this semester. During the last
week of the semester, you will give a brief presentation of the tutorial. I
will make all of these available on the class website so that everyone can
read and benefit from them.

We will discuss other possibilities in class, but here are several options of
topics for the project:

- using the `glm` function to fit a logistic regression
- motivation and usage of a fixed effects model
- usage of an [ROpenSci package](https://ropensci.org/packages/)
- how to make interactive graphics
- how to make animated graphics
- how to visualize network data
- using the `melt` function
- using the `gather` function
- making use of "base" graphics
- loading, writing, and basic manipulation of image data
- running a topic model over a corpus of texts

I will meet with everyone while working on this project to make sure the scope
of the tutorial is neither too narrow nor too broad.
