\textbf{Description:} \vspace{6pt}

This course broadly covers the entire process of collecting,
cleaning, visualizing, modeling, and presenting datasets. The focus
is on applied statistics and data analysis rather than a detailed
study of symbolic mathematics. It has a MATH designation but is not
a \textit{mathematics} course. By the end of the semester you will
feel confident collecting, analyzing, and writing about datasets
from a variety of fields. You will be able to use these skills to
address data-driven problems in a wide range of application domains.

\bigskip

\textbf{Course Website:} \vspace{6pt}

All of the materials and assignments for the course will be posted
on the class website:
\begin{quote}
\url{https://statsmaths.github.io/stat209-f18}
\end{quote}
The website contains notes, assignment details, and
supplemental materials. At the end of the semester, this version of
the course will be archived and available for your reference.

\bigskip

\textbf{Computing:} \vspace{6pt}

To facilitate your ability to actually \textit{do} statistics,
most class meetings will involve some form of computing.
No prior programming experience is assumed or required.

\medskip

We will use the \textbf{R} programming environment throughout the
semester. It is freely available for all major operating systems and
is pre-installed on many campus computers. You can download it and
all supporting files for your own machine via these links:
\begin{center}
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/} \\
\url{https://www.rstudio.com/}
\end{center}
The lab computers in Jepson are available and contain all of the
required software. I strongly recommend, however, downloading these
on your own machine so that you will be able to work on assignments
without needing to work only in the computer lab.

\bigskip

\textbf{Labs:} \vspace{6pt}

Nearly every course meeting will have an associated lab to complete. We will
usually work on these in class. By the start of the next course meeting, you
must complete the questions contained within the lab notebook. Assignments
will be submitted through GitHub; this process will explained in more detail
during class. \\

\bigskip

\textbf{Midterm Exams:} \vspace{6pt}

The course will have three in-class exams throughout the semester. These will
resemble the daily lab assignments and will be administered on the computers
in our classroom. Dates for these exams will be distributed roughly evenly
throughout the first twelve weeks of the course:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{Midterm I}: 2018-09-20 (Thursday)
\item \textbf{Midterm II}: 2018-10-23 (Tuesday)
\item \textbf{Midterm III}: 2018-11-15 (Thursday)
\end{itemize}
The two weeks of class following Thanksgiving break will be focused on
finishing and presenting your final data project.\\

\bigskip

\textbf{Data Projects:} \vspace{6pt}

While the midterms serve to make sure you are following along
with the general concepts, the ultimate aim of the course is to teach
you how to \textit{apply} statistics to real-world questions. To
this end, you will also complete a final data-oriented project for the
course. Details for this project and how it will be graded will be given
towards the middle of the term. The final week of the course will consist
of presentations of your findings.

\bigskip

\textbf{Final Grades:} \vspace{6pt}

The final grade will be determined by weighting the labs, exams, and project
as follows:
\begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item \textbf{Labs and Participation}: 20\%
\item \textbf{Midterm Exams}: 60\% (20\% each)
\item \textbf{Final Project}: 20\%
\end{itemize}
Course expectations and community standards will be discussed, developed and
distributed in the first week of the course. This will include policies for
class participation, attendance, and late work.

\bigskip

\textbf{Weekly Topics:} \vspace{6pt}

These are subject to change, but will give you a sense of what will be covered

% \item
%   basic techniques for accessing variables in data objects
% \item
%   selecting variable names
% \item
%   constructing a data dictionary
% \end{itemize}

% \bigskip

% \underline{Week 02, Variable types and numeric summaries:}
% We begin our study of tabular data, with observations stored in rows and
% variables stored in columns. We start by describing the types of
% data that can be stored. Next, methods for summarizing and graphing
% numeric and categorical data are developed.
% \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}

% \item
%   differentiate between numeric and categorical data
% \item
%   treating numeric data as categorical data
% \item
%   create categorical variables by grouping numeric data
% \end{itemize}

% \bigskip

% \underline{Week 03, The Grammar of Graphics:}
% Building off of our basic plots, here we describe a self-contained
% system for the creation of statistical graphics. Putting the topics
% together allow for the construction of arbitrarily complex
% visualizations of data.

% \item
%   the basic data aesthetics (x, y, label, color, size, and alpha)
% \item
%   the \textbf{ggplot2} syntax
% \item
%   mapping variables to aesthetics
% \item
%   setting fixed aesthetics
% \item
%   constructing layers of points, lines
% \end{itemize}

% \bigskip

% \underline{Week 04, Advanced Graphics:}
% Here we build off of the grammar of graphics to include
% other layer types, manual annotations, and building
% professional graphics.
% \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
% \item
%   describe scales and themes in the grammar of graphics
% \item

% an analysis. In this unit, we study techniques for filtering and
% restructuring data. One particular focus is the study of how to
% change the \textit{level of analysis} of a data set, such as taking
% data originally about individuals and turning it into a dataset to
% study cities or counties.
% \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
% \item
%   syntax of the filter command
% \item
%   boolean variables
% \item
%   binary operators: ``and'', ``or''
% \item
%   binary operators: greater than, less than
% \item
%   set containment
% \item
%   random subsets
% \item
%   syntax of the summarize command
% \item
%   counting grouped data
% \end{itemize}

% \bigskip

% \underline{Week 06, Statistical Inference:}
% Given a sample of data taken from a larger population, we can use
% models to estimate how well the sample resembles the entire population.
% This unit covers an introduction to these techniques, known as statistical
% inference. The same techniques can be used to study the outcome of random
% processes.
% \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0em}
% \item
%   sample and population statistics

% \end{itemize}

% \bigskip

% \underline{Week 10, Joining Relational Data:}
% We also build off of the last week's material by exploring
% concepts of data manipulation and data
% collection to describe methods for working simultaneously with many
% tables linked together by common keys.
